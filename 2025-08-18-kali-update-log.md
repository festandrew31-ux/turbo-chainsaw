# üóìÔ∏è August 18, 2025 ‚Äì Kali VM Update & Linux Learning Progress
# Duration : 2.5 hours
## System Update

Today I am updating my Kali Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox.  
Due to slow WiFi, the process is taking longer than usual.

**Update Command:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- *Triggered nearly 600 package updates!*

## Learning Goals (Post-Update)

Once the updates complete, I plan to cover the following topics:

### 1. **Linux Journey**
- Core shell commands
- Permissions & access control
- Managing processes

### 2. **Linux Survival**
- File system structure
- Groups and users management
- Additional file system operations (time permitting)

---

## Notes

- The slow WiFi is a challenge, but the upgrade is essential for security and new features.
- If time allows, I'll dive deeper into hands-on exercises for each topic.

**Next Steps:**  
After all updates are installed, will begin with shell command practice and progress through the topics listed above.
