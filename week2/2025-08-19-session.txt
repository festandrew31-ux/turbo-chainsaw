# Terminal Session: Setting Up Git & Repository (2025-08-19)

## Summary
This session documents the steps taken to configure Git and work with local and remote repositories on a Kali Linux environment. The actions include updating packages, configuring Git user details, file management, and troubleshooting Git authentication.

---

### 1. System & Environment
- **OS:** Kali Linux
- **Terminal:** xterm-256color

---

### 2. System Update
```bash
sudo apt update
```
- Packages were checked for updates.
- No packages were upgraded, installed, or removed.
- Some Python packages listed as no longer required.

---

### 3. Git Installation & Configuration
- Verified Git installation:
  ```bash
  git --version
  # Output: git version 2.50.1
  ```
- Attempted to set global Git config using incorrect syntax, received error messages:
  - `error: key does not contain a section: festandrew31-ux`
  - `error: key does not contain a section: festandrew31`
- Corrected Git config setup:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "festandrew31-ux"
  git config --global user.email "festandrew31@gmail.com"
  ```
- Verified configuration:
  ```bash
  git config --global --list
  # Output:
  # user.name=festandrew31-ux
  # user.email=festandrew31@gmail.com
  ```

### 4. File & Directory Management
- Created directories for organizing project files:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/cyber_rebuild/week1
  mkdir -p ~/post-nucamp-rebuild/week1
  ```
- Copied session file:
  ```bash
  cp ~/cyber_rebuild/week1/session_tue.txt ~/post-nucamp-rebuild/week1/
  ```

### 5. Git Repository Operations
- Attempted to clone a repository using an incorrect URL:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/festandrew31-ux/turbo-chainsaw.git
  # Error: no such file or directory
  ```
- Initialized a new Git repository locally:
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
- Added remote origin:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/festandrew31-ux/post-nucamp-rebuild.git
  ```
- **Authentication Issue:**
  - Entered password when prompted, but received:
    ```
    remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
    fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/festandrew31-ux/post-nucamp-rebuild.git/'
    ```
  - **Note:** Modern Git requires use of personal access tokens (PAT) instead of passwords for remote operations.

---

### 6. Troubleshooting
- Attempted operations in directories that were not Git repositories.
- Resolved configuration errors and clarified correct commands for future use.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Correct Git configuration syntax is essential.
- Use personal access tokens for GitHub authentication.
- Organize projects with logical directories.
- Read error messages carefully for troubleshooting.
