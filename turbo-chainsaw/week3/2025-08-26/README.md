**Objective:** Cleaning up repo structure and moving setup scripts.

### Commands Run
- Attempted to create `~/path-to-your-repo/week2` (failed)
- Corrected path: `~/cyber_rebuild/week2`
- Moved setup files into the proper folder

### Notes
- Error due to missing directory path was corrected by pointing to the actual repo root.
- Confusion cleared up: always start from `~/cyber_rebuild` (repo root).
