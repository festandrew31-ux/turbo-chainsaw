# Daily Cybersecurity Practice Log
**Date:** August 14, 2025

## Activities
- Spent 4 hours re-installing fresh virtual machines (Kali Linux and Ubuntu) inside VirtualBox.
- Transitioned away from Multipass VM setup (will retain for future use).
- Created a daily cybersecurity checklist, broken into three phases.

## Checklist Phases
1. **Phase 1: Core Skill Rebuild (Weeks 1–4)**
   - Focus on fundamental cybersecurity concepts, hands-on labs, and tool familiarization.
2. **Phase 2: Projects, GitHub, Resume (Weeks 5–8)**
   - Build and document projects, update GitHub portfolio, refresh resume.
3. **Phase 3: Job Search & Applications (Weeks 9–12)**
   - Research job opportunities, apply, prepare for interviews.

## Notes
- Chose VirtualBox for more granular VM control and snapshot management.
- Multipass VM setup has been deprecated for active workflow, but will be kept for ad-hoc needs.

**Reflection:** Fresh VM installations provide a clean environment for skill development and project work.
